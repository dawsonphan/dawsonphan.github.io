## 👋 Hi, I’m Dawson Phan

I’m a **PhD student in Microbiology** at **The Ohio State University**, supervised by [Dr. Matthew Sullivan](https://u.osu.edu/viruslab/).  

My research combines systems thinking with interdisciplinary and quantitative approaches to explore how microbial and viral communities shape the environment.

---

## 🧪 Scientific Philosophy

I’m passionate about:
- **Ecological and environmental systems** (especially marine!)
- **Quantitative reasoning** through applied math, statistics, and computation
- **Disciplinary integration**, bringing biology, computer science, and math together

My undergrad training (BSc, McGill University, 2018–2022) emphasized deep contextual learning across biology, oceanography, and data science—giving me a strong foundation in both domain knowledge and analytical methods.

---

## 🎯 PhD Goals

- **Tell compelling stories** about microbial and viral dynamics using robust analytical frameworks  
- **Develop novel methods** that make sense of metagenomes and -omics in emerging ecosystems  
- **Build tools** to help the scientific community make better inferences in microbiome/virome research

## 🪸 1. Viral Roles in Coral Holobionts

> _"Corals are holobionts—complex partnerships of the coral host, dinoflagellates, bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses."_

- Coral reefs house >30% of marine biodiversity but occupy <1% of the ocean floor.
- While dinoflagellate symbioses are well-studied, the role of **viruses** remains poorly understood.

📍 I’m exploring:
- The **baseline viral community** in healthy Pacific corals
- Potential **viral drivers of disease** in Caribbean coral outbreaks

## 📊 2. Analytical & Statistical Modeling of Microbiomes and Viromes

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/modeling.png" alt="Modeling graphic" style="margin: 1em 0;">
</p>

Microbiome and virome sciences are growing fast—but our tools often lag behind.

I focus on:
- Interpreting **how current methods shape the microbial stories we tell**
- Bridging gaps in interdisciplinary training with **custom frameworks and pipelines**
- Enhancing **data depth and dimensionality** across -omics and environmental datasets

---

## 🌱 3. Microbial & Viral Climate Solutions

Imagine if we could:
- Predict how microbial/viral dynamics shift with climate change
- Leverage those insights for **ecosystem monitoring and management**
- Create tools like **phage therapies** to **restore ecosystem health**

I aim to support these goals through:
- **Community knowledge co-creation**
- **Environmental engineering with microbes and viruses**
- **Applied science for planetary-scale challenges**
